# Flight Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes flight data to gain insights into airline pricing, departure and arrival trends, source and destination city statistics, and other key patterns. The project is implemented using **Python** and popular data analysis libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

---

## Features
- **Airline Analysis:** Count and visualize flights per airline.  
- **Departure & Arrival Analysis:** Analyze flights by departure and arrival times.  
- **Source & Destination Cities:** Visualize the number of flights from each city.  
- **Price Analysis:** Explore flight prices over days left until departure.  
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Bar charts, horizontal bar charts, and line plots for clear insights.
